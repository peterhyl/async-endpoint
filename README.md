# Async endpoint
Simple asynchronous endpoint to fetch data from database by name. I used
non-blocking technology peewee-async and aiohttp for asynchronous web endpoint
to fetching data(or create new) from database.
# Deployment instruction:
Developed by Python 3.6, you can use virtual env.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now you can run the application
```
python async_endpoint.py
```
Application is routed on localhost and port 8080: http://127.0.0.1:8080 .
